This folder shall consist of all codes that I type while I learn how to code in Python. 
I shall be skipping a few basic topics that have been covered in C/C++. At the end of each day, a pdf/jpg file containing my handwritten notes will also be attached here.

I am mostly relying on tutorials available on docs.python.org

Day 1:
	>Installed python 3.6.4 .
	>Studied notes upto heading 3: An Informal Introduction to Python.
	>Practised a few code snippets directly on the interactive console.
